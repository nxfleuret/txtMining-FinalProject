Most of the world's agricultural extension services are funded and delivered by the public sector with the private sector contributing approximately 5%. The low private sector engagement in provision of agricultural extension may be attributed to poor enabling environment, which has deterred rather than encouraged private sector investment. Debates on engaging private sector in agricultural extension argue that private investment in extension is bound to generate agricultural productivity. Consequently, PPPs in agriculture are considered to be drivers for modernization of the sector. However, the promotion of PPPs for agricultural development to-date has placed limited emphasis on the enabling environment which supports the formation and implementation of these partnerships. This article adopts an exploratory research design and used a qualitative approach backed by document review and semi-structured interviews to collect data. This article presents a sector diagnosis of the policy, legal and regulatory frameworks for PPP in agricultural extension in Uganda.
