The teaching and learning of engineering courses are always challenging due to its complex and abstract nature, and the mathematics involved. With diminishing resources (e.g., continuous funding cut, frequent professional/academic staff career movement, lack of competent professional staff, inadequate laboratory infrastructures), teaching and learning of engineering courses become harder and it is progressively becoming difficult to teach basic engineering courses effectively. As a result, students cannot achieve effective learning outcomes. To overcome these challetiges, a three-step teaching approach has been developed to enhance students' learning outcomes. This approach is cost effective, user-friendly and attractive. The method comprises a real laboratory demonstration video clip, conduction of a real laboratory experiment and a computer simulation/modelling. The developed three-step teaching and learning approach can be applied to any engineering courses.
