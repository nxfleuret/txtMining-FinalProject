Since its launch in 1977, Computers & Chemical Engineering has published numerous papers on the application of computing technology to chemical engineering problems. In this paper, we present a topic analysis of the journal using various text mining techniques. In particular, we examine the dramatic growth of the journal’s topic coverage since the 1970s. We found that the journal exhibits a similar popularity across all 18 topics covered today. Certain topics have grown rapidly in the last decade, and are now among the journal’s most covered topics.
