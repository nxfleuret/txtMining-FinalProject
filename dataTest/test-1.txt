The field of shape grammars spans 47 years, but its potential in the practice andeducation of art, architecture, and engineering remains far from being utilized. Similarly,while reverse engineering in some engineering disciplines is well-established, its implementa-tion in architectural design remains under-represented. By combining the two domains, thispaper develops a novel method that merges the power of shape grammars as a parsing toolin reverse engineering to decode the morphogenesis of visual compositions in architecturaldesign. The merged power is demonstrated by decoding the formal language of a fac ̧ade designof a case study, in which seemingly few simple rules can derive surprisingly complex composi-tions. The rules of the language can then be used to reconstruct parts of the case fac ̧ade. Mostshape grammars in the architectural literature are applied on formal historical precedents, butthe subject of morphological analysis in this paper is contemporary and has a style that ex-hibits non-orthogonal configurations, which initially appear far from being standardized or sub-jected to regulatory tectonic rules. The fac ̧ade derivation grammar is explained and re-synthesized in various computations to explore emergent articulations that display its predic-tive, synthetic, and generative powers in addition to typical analytic ones.
