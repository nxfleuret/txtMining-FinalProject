The purpose of this paper is to further investigate engineering ethics and its gap within accident analysis models. In this paper, at first, the role of human factors in the occurrence of accidents is presented. Then engineering ethics as an element of human factors is proposed. It is suggested that engineering ethics can provide engineers with the necessary guidelines to avoid possible accidents arising from their decisions and actions. In addition, the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle case studies that demonstrate the role of engineering ethics in the prevention and occurrence of accidents are discussed. Then sequential, epidemiological, and systemic accident analysis models are briefly investigated and negligence of engineering ethics as a gap in the accident analysis models is described. At the end, we suggest that by implementing engineering ethics as a controller within the system boundary in systemic accident models we may be able to identify and prevent the ethical causes of accidents.
